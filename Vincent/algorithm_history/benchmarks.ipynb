Issues could arise from the fact that a bot lifts our ask (leaving us in a short position) and then the asset price increases. So we must also increase our bid and ask, then we must quote higher bid prices (which end up being higher than our intial ask price), when a bot hits our bid, we must buy at a higher price than we sold at intially --> a loss.\n",

    "Before we hard coded the spread. This wouldn't be scalable in the future as we would need to determine and hard code the spread values. Thus we decided to code a way to find the average spread of the last 20 time periods. Then we would trade if and only if our current_spread > avg_spread*scale_factor. Where avg_spread is the average spread in the last 20 (changeable) time periods and scale factor is a multiplier. Currently we have best successes with scale factors of 0.8 - 1. Lower scale factors mean more trades are eligbile and and thus more trades, but potentially bad trades. Higher scale factors mean less trades, but more potential profit for each trade.\n",
